I am currently a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, NASP Lab, advised by Prof. [Dan Li](https://nasp.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lidan.html). I also receive academic training at Zhongguancun Laboratory, advised by Dr. [Li Chen](https://li-ch.github.io/resume/) (Assistance Researcher) and Dr. [Kaihui Gao](https://gaokaihui.com/) (Assistant Researcher).

My research interests fall on Machine Learning System (MLSys) and AI for Network Operations (AIOps) . My recent focus centers on multi-agent system, including efficient agent post-training paradigms and their usage in networking scenarios. 

Before I started my Ph.D., I received B.E. and B.Ec. at Tsinghua University in June 2023.
